Automation is becoming essential to make human work easier. Automation in medical field is required to get accurate measures of the parameters that are measured because automation provides more accuracy.From face to face consultation to Telemedicine the healthcare patterns are changing according to human needs.Remote access to healthcare is becoming the need of every nation worldwide. Remote health monitoring systems help patients to monitor their health based on certain parameters such as heart rate, pulse rate ,room temperature, eye movement that are measured.If there is any change in the values of those parameters the concerned doctor gets notified about it by the patient and the analysis is done by using the past days data and the best treatment is prescribed by the doctor.Our aim is to create a  patient management and monitoring system based on IoT so that the healthcare professionals can monitor their patients remotely, who are either hospitalized or are at home using AWS IoT Core Service based integrated healthcare system to ensure quality patient care.The data collected using AWS is visualized and analyzed so that correct conclusions can be drawn for patients treatment.This will help patients to get treated in their home environment which is more effective for a fast recovery. In this way  the patient and the doctor will have to do less effort for constant monitoring and medical report analysis, further it reduces the time and cost for getting medical help and procedures.Our target audience for the product is people who need constant monitoring which can only be provided in hospitals  or people in rural areas who donâ€™t have access to healthcare.
